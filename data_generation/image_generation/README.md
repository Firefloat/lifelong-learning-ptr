# Data Download
First download the [PartNet dataset](https://partnet.cs.stanford.edu/), denoted as data_dir.

Then download the [Cart Category from PartNet Mobility Dataset](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/browse), denoted as cart_dir. Same as data_dir, cart_dir contains a list of ids of the cart shapes.

# Blender#
We render synthetic images using [Blender2.78](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-78/), outputting both rendered images as well as a JSON file containing ground-truth scene information for each image.

Blender ships with its own installation of Python which is used to execute scripts that interact with Blender; you'll need to add the image_generation directory to Python path of Blender's bundled Python. The easiest way to do this is by adding a .pth file to the site-packages directory of Blender's Python, like this:

```
echo $PWD >> $BLENDER/$VERSION/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/ptr.pth
```

where $BLENDER is the directory where Blender is installed and $VERSION is your Blender version; for example on Linux you might run:
```
echo $PWD > /usr/local/blender/2.78/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/ptr.pth
```

on OSX you might run:

```
echo $PWD >> /Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.78/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/ptr.pth
```

On OSX the blender binary is located inside the blender.app directory; for convenience you may want to add the following alias to your ~/.bash_profile file:

alias blender='/Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender'

# PTR Image Generation
First, 
Images are generated by using Blender to invoke the script `render_images_partnet.py` like this:

```
blender --background --python render_images_partnet.py -- [args]
```

*e.g.,*
```
blender --background --python render_images_partnet.py -- --data_dir [data_dir] --cart_dir [cart_dir] --num_images 2000 --tmp_dir tmp1 --gpu 1
```

Any arguments following the `--` will be captured by `render_images_partnet.py`.

This command should be run from the `image_generation` directory, since by default the script will load resources from the `data` directory.

When rendering on cluster machines without audio drivers installed you may need to add the `-noaudio` flag to the Blender invocation like this:

```
blender --background -noaudio --python render_images_partnet.py -- [args]
```
